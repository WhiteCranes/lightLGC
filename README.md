The model will be trained with a specific focus on everyday conversation rather than code generation, mathematical computation, paper indexing, etc. It will also allow for the selection of various parameters to achieve different language styles. This model can be applied to NPC dialogue in open-world games, electronic pets, intelligent guides, and more.
